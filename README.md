## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

Using Styled Components still causes some frustration, so I have to look into that a bit deeper.

### Useful resources

-   [Talia Marcassa - Styled Components: To Use or Not to Use?](https://medium.com/building-crowdriff/styled-components-to-use-or-not-to-use-a6bb4a7ffc21) - This is a really good article that I found during the debugging one of the issues with Styled Components. It's worth reading.
