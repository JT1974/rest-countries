## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable with Styled Components and more specifically prop passing (e.g. background-image src prop for a div), avoiding warnings about having multiple components with the same id (using the attrs() method of Styled Components).

I found a good article from [Talia Marcassa - Styled Components: To Use or Not to Use?](https://medium.com/building-crowdriff/styled-components-to-use-or-not-to-use-a6bb4a7ffc21)

She also wrote about Styled Components' ThemeProvider and testing the styling of components with Jest, which topics also sound very interesting and I'm planning to look into these a bit later.

### Useful resources

-   [Styled Componentns FAQ](https://styled-components.com/docs/faqs#when-to-use-attrs) - I've been wrestling with Styled Components in my latest projects with more, or less success, however I still could not get a grip on passing props to styled components. The doc is very useful in general, but I still haven't found the solution for the issueI described above.
-   [Talia Marcassa - Styled Components: To Use or Not to Use?](https://medium.com/building-crowdriff/styled-components-to-use-or-not-to-use-a6bb4a7ffc21) - This is a really good article that I found during the debugging of the above issue. It's worth reading.
